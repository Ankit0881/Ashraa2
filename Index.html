    <p>To my Pati Parmeshwar🌸, 
Finally, I have the best man. The man who knows me well. The man who listens to me. The man who treats me right. The man who loves me even though I'm a handful💋🎀The man who puts up with my attitude
I'm so thankful 🤭 I still remember the very first time we met , the most and favourite moment is when we eye contact with each other’s and your smile and how everything happened unexpectedly we both didn't expect, it was god who made it happen, because he knows we both need each other to complete the love story he made and after 6 years it’s finally happening 🤭🌷 
 Mere liye sabse best memory wohi thi jb humlg baatein kr rhe the stairs ke side pe baith ke!!😭🌸( April 2nd ,2021 Around 11:45) i know you wont believe me but yes i do remember thing jo mere liye khas hoti hai🥹🫶🏼 tumne meri baatein suni aur maine tumhri💕 (Phirse recreate krna hai😭) Overall mujhe bas tumse ye kehna hai ki 🫶🏼
           Agar hona chahu tera Tum hone doge kya, Rona chahu tumhre pass aake Tum rone doge kya, Chain nahi mil raha ab mujhe kahi pe Tum apne dil mein chain se rehne doge kya???🌷🫶🏼</p>
